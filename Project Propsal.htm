	 <h2>Project Objective</h2>
<p>
The project objective is to share the rhythm of Caribbean culture by highlighting the diversity and richness of the music. The design will showcase at least 4 different music genres within the Caribbean which include Reggae, Calypso, Dancehall and Soca. The site will include the history of each genre, where it originated, which countries its commonly played in, the instruments typically used to create each genre. Users will also be able to explore at least 10-30 different artists/bands' biographies, and understand their impact on the global music scene.
</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
My website is targeted at fans of Caribbean music, locally and internationally, but also people who are genuinely interested in learning more about Caribbean culture through its music. So it's designed to appeal to both casual listeners and those seeking knowledge about the different genres, featured artists, and the carnivals that celebrate the music.
</p>

<h2>Content Plan for Each Page</h2>
<p>
Aside from the required "Home Page", "Contact Me", "About Me", "Credits" Page, I will have an additional 6 pages. Four of these pages will explore the different genres music from the Caribbean (History behind each genre, playlist of songs, the instruments typically associated with the respective genre). Another page will include artist profiles (Biography, where they're from, which genre they associate most with...).The last page will include a site map and inform users of carnivals around the world that celebrates this world of music. Depending on time, I may potentially include a seventh page with a form for an interactive user experience where they can sumbit music recs or play a trivia game.
