<h2 id="AM">About Me</h2>
		<p>
 Hello! My name is Deanna, and I am currently a Senior at <a href="https://www.babson.edu/">Babson College</a>, pursuing a degree in Business Management with a concentration in Operations. Over the past two summers, Iâ€™ve had the incredible opportunity to intern at Harvard Business Publishing, where I worked first on the Content Editorial team and then transitioned to the Product Development team. These experiences have deepened my understanding of business processes and product innovation, sparking my passion for operational management. Originally from Brooklyn, New York, and with family roots in Guyana, I take great pride in being a first-generation college student. My journey is shaped by a desire to create positive change within my community, particularly by improving systems that support underrepresented groups. This goal drives my curiosity and fuels my interest in business management and operations. My long-term vision is to leverage my education and experiences to develop solutions that create lasting impact, both in my community and beyond.

	<h2 id="MH">My Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I come from a pretty sporty family that plays soccer, cricket, and runs track, so staying active has always been a big part of my life. I started playing basketball in middle school as a way to clear my mind, and over the years it has grown into one of my favorite hobbies.
